# Frequently Asked Questions
## GENERAL INFORMATION

### WHAT IS THE CLIMATE RISK RESEARCH CHALLENGE?

Agriculture plays a vital role in Nigeria's economy, providing employment opportunities and contributing to the country's gross domestic product (GDP).

However, the sector faces numerous physical risks, including droughts and floods, which can have severe consequences on crop yields, food security, and livelihoods.

The Climate Research Research Challenge aims to develop physical risk and resilience models for Nigeria's different regions that consider drought and flood hazards on agriculture and food security.

The thematic areas are:

1. Develop physical risk and resilience models for Nigeria's different regions using open-source tools and data.
2. Identify and evaluate drought and flood hazards that could impact agriculture in Nigeria.
3. Identify and assess the vulnerability of different crops to drought and flood hazards.
4. Develop recommendations for building resilience to drought and flood hazards in Nigeria's agriculture sector.
