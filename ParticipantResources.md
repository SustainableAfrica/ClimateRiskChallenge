## Using GitHub
### Structure
Each Climate Risk Challenge is structured based on country, university, and team.  As an example:  SustainableAfrica / ClimateRiskChallenge / Nigeria / Lagos University / Team A 
### Commitment to Open-Source & Creation of a Public Good for Africa
Each team must agree to develop their solution/model using an open source license such as Apache 2.0.  Due to the prizes involved, teams will initially work in private repositories.  Once the winners of a Challenge are announced, all repositories associated with a given challenge will be made public for the benefit of all Africans.
### GitHub Access
Particpants will need to obtain a GitHub ID.  Access to your team's GitHub repository will be based on GitHub ID.
