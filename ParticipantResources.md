## Using GitHub
### GitHub Basics
New to GitHub?  Learn more [here](https://github.com/SustainableAfrica/ClimateRiskChallenge/blob/main/UsingGitHub.md#getting-started-with-github-an-overview-and-basics)
### Structure
Each Climate Risk Challenge is structured based on country, university, and team.  As an example:  SustainableAfrica / ClimateRiskChallenge / Nigeria / Lagos University / Team A 
### Commitment to Open-Source & Creation of a Public Good for Africa
Each team must agree to develop their solution/model using an open source license such as Apache 2.0.  Due to the prizes involved, teams will initially work in private repositories.  Once the winners of a Challenge are announced, all repositories associated with a given challenge will be made public for the benefit of all Africans.
### GitHub Access
Particpants will need to obtain a GitHub ID.  Access to your team's GitHub repository will be based on GitHub ID.
## Accessing AWS Cloud Resources
### Thank You, AWS, for your generous donation!
Each team will be given a project team identifier in GitHub (e.g., challenge-teamX).  Once your team members' GitHub usernames are attached to that team, they can access cloud resources using [OpenDataHub](https://odh-dashboard-opendatahub.apps.ch-cl1.apps.sustainableafricainitiative.org/projects/)

For information on how to use Open Data Hub, please visit [ODH's website](https://opendatahub.io/docs/getting-started-with-open-data-hub/)
